# PATBasicLevel

- This repo aims to document the problems I've solved in PAT.
- To thoroughly solve a problem, need these elements:
  - (Accepted) Code with comment
  - Docs to illustrate my thread of thought
  - pesudo-code
  - the space and time efficiency anlysis
  - Compare my code with others and reflection.

---
- So to throughly solve a problem, I need to follow a seven step strategy:
  1. Understand the problem. **Write down the sample case and get it right by hand.**
  2. In main() method, provide a **test()** method and a **solve()** method and make some testcases and its answer.
  3. Write down the pesudo-code, make it clear **how many methods(for modularity) do I need**.
  4. At the head of a method, write down the **meanings** of the local variables.
  5. In each method, write a **println log** to tell myself what the **input&output** is and the final state of some **temp varibles**.
  6. **Test** by test() method.
  7. **Submit** the final version.
